# Weather App Backlog

Last updated: Sun 24, November

## Features

### Static components

- [x] Create app static components (container + hard coded data):
  - [x] select form (manual selection with dropdown menu)
  - [x] map
  - [x] dashboard (displayng data)

- [x] Import static components into HomePage

### Dynamic components

- [x] Select location coordinates:
  - [x] place pin on map (data: lat, lng)
  - [x] geolocate user

- [x] Dynamically display data on dashboard:
  - [x] request with lat and long as params
  - [x] handle location update and data refresh
  - [x] update store

- [x] Separate weather data for the day and current conditions:
  - [x] update dashboard layout and structure
  - [x] improve types and data recollection?

- [ ] Display weather alerts on dashboard
  - [ ] create dedicated popup

## Design

- [x] Create basic layout:
  - [x] global design and layout
  - [x] select form (manual selection)
  - [x] map
  - [x] dashboard (displaying data)

- [x] Refine layout and style:
  - [x] HomePage component
  - [x] Dashboard component
  - [x] Map component

## Fix

- [x] Map view does not follow marker generated by geolocation
- [ ] "Adress" consists of lat and long coordinates:
  - [ ] get approximate location/city based on coordinates?
- [x] Truncate lat and long coordinates

## Nice To Have

- [ ] Manually select a city:
  - [ ] map lat and long coordinates to a list of cities
  - [ ] select from dropdown menu

- [ ] Display forcast per hour
